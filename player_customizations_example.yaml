# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FILE
# Copy this format into player_customizations.yaml to customize for real
#
# ------------ MODIFYING BATTERS ---------------
# Put new entry seperated by - for each player that requires custom actions
# name: Player's name
#
# mlb_id:
#   REQUIRED
#
# score_multiplier:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is 1.0
#   To exclude a player set the score_multiplier = 0.0
#   To force include a player make score multiplier a high number like 1000.0
#
# batting_rates:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified batting rates unadjusted
#   Rates must be fully specified and sum to 1.0
#   NOTE: These rates are substituted in at the last second so they will not
#   be adjusted for park or opposing pitcher.
#   WARNING: This will not affect player's stats against relievers
#
# batting_rates_multiplier:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is 1.0
#   This multiplies the specified hit rates (e.g. HR) and then renormalizes
#   So HR: 5 makes it 5 times as likely for the player to hit a HR
#   NOTE: These rates are substituted in at the last second so they will not
#   be adjusted for park or opposing pitcher.
#   WARNING: This will not affect player's stats against relievers
#
# POS:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is all positions
#   To apply only to the batter if they are taken as the specified position
#   Most useful to lock in players for late player swaps
#
#  ------------ MODIFYING TEAM ----------------
# Put new entry seperated by - for each team that requires custom actions
#
# team_id:
#   REQUIRED
#
# hit_rate_multiplier:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is 1.0
#   This multiplies the hit rates (HR, 3B, 2B, 1B) and then renormalizes
#   So hit_rate_multiplier = 2.0 makes it twice as likely for an on base hit
#   NOTE: This affects all players on the team and happens after any player
#   specific adjustments are made
#   WARNING: This will not affect player's stats against relievers
#
# batting_rates_multiplier:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is 1.0
#   This multiplies the specified hit rates (e.g. HR) and then renormalizes
#   So HR: 5 makes it 5 times as likely for the team to hit a HR
#   NOTE: These rates are substituted in at the last second so they will not
#   be adjusted for park or opposing pitcher.
#   WARNING: This will not affect player's stats against relievers
#
# score_multiplier:
#   OPTIONAL    If unspecified default is 1.0
#   To exclude a team from consideration (i.e. rainouts) set equal to 0.0
#   NOTE: score multiplier will be applied after any player specific changes
#   WARNING: This only affects batters not pitchers
#
# bat_hand:
#  OPTIONAL     If unspecified default is applies to all batters
#  Specifies if the adjustments apply to only batters of a certain handedness
#  # TODO: what does this mean about switch hitters
